# Good apps to learn English speaking 

Are you an introvert who's afraid of making mistakes when speaking? 
Do you lack an environment to practice your speaking skills? 
With the development of AI, there's now a solution for you! Here are some apps I've tried and found quite good, with prices ranging from a few hundred thousand to under 5 million VND for a whole year of use.

**Speak**

If you want to learn from the simplest phrases, especially if you're starting from scratch, this is the right app for you.
Besides English, you can also use it to learn Spanish.
Price updated December 2024: about 1.3 million VND/year for the premium package, and about 2.9 million VND/year for the premium plus package.

**BeeSpeaker**
It has a learning method and app organization quite similar to Speak, cheaper price (12/2024: about 1.5 million VND/year), the lessons from the beginning have longer and more complex sentences than Speak, suitable for people who already have some knowledge.

**Praktika.ai**
Free speaking and guided speaking, quite detailed and easy to understand analysis. The only downside is that you can't replay the conversation you just had. The price, if not discounted, I remember was also quite high, but with a discount, the app offered me a price of about 800k/year (12/2024).
Besides learning English, you can also use it to learn Spanish, but I think you need to know a little bit of speaking before using this app to learn Spanish, because the AI asks a lot of questions that beginners won't be able to answer.

**Speak English with Loora AI**
Quite similar to Pratika, but with a simpler and easier to use interface, detailed feedback, suggesting ways to improve right at the bad words in your sentence, with role-playing, listening to conversations to learn, although the price is a bit higher but also very worth the money.

Price: About 3 million VND/year (12/2024)

**Falou**

Pros: Teaches you to read each word before putting it into a sentence.
Cons: Not flexible in speaking, this app is quite similar to Elsa rather than talking to AI, but the price is cheap (not sure about the original price, but the app offered me a discount of about 290k - 450k (12/2024), and especially you can learn many other languages, not just English or Spanish, beginners can also learn.

**iTalkuTalk**
Pros: Learn to speak through very interesting videos, with AI correction, this is also a very famous app in the world of language learners. You can use the free version and love it, if you want full features + support the developer, the price is only about 700k (12/2024).
Cons: I remember this app is from a developer in Taiwan, so if you learn Chinese, the writing is traditional, not simplified.

**Langotalk**

Webapp: [https://www.langotalk.org/Lobby](https://www.langotalk.org/Lobby)
The advantage is multilingual, the price is not too expensive, there is a lifetime subscription (1.2025: about $150 for lifetime).
Cons: Using it on the phone app, I find it a bit laggy, have to wait a bit. In general, if you don't have a problem with waiting a little bit, this app is extremely good!

In addition, you can buy Elsa Premium, or PrepTalk, which also has AI speaking (the price is somewhere around 2 million - 3 million VND/year).
In general, with the development of AI, learning to speak English has become much simpler, easier and more economical, with a price of under 5 million VND, you can learn to speak for a whole year. If you have more conditions, you can buy 2+ apps to take advantage of the strengths of many apps. Once you get used to speaking with the app, you just need to confidently speak with foreigners, and you will definitely improve a lot.
